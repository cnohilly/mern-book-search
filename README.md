# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

This project was to take a MERN stack application and make the necessary changes to utilize GraphQL for handling their API and data manipulation. The initial application, which was given with [this provided starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli), was built using React for the front-end, a MongoDB database, and Node/Express.js server and API. The application begins with a RESTful API setup and by the end is functioning using a GraphQL setup with TypeDefs, Resolvers and front-end queries and mutations for handling user authentication and MongoDB data interface.
